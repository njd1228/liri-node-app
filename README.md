 LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface, similar in a way to Apple's SIRI on iOS devices (SIRI is a Speach Interpreation and Recognition Interface). LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data from various APIs (in this case we are pulling a lot of the data from Twitter and Spotify)
